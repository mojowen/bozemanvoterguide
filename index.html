                                Finding solutions to affordable housing is a priority for me.This includes single family homes, multi-family homes and affordable rental housing. As we look to redevelop Midtown (N. 7th corridor) and possible expansion of the N. 7th TIF opportunities for more housing may exist. Additionally more housing for students near the University makes sense especially as we think about where where housing is needed and where city services currently exist. The University faculty and students are integral part of our community and as the University grows and the community grows affordable housing is essential. We are in the process of developing an Affordable Housing plan with many partners to be in place later this fall.

                                During the last legislative session, I encouraged the Governor to Veto SB 241 (establish one minimum wage across the state) because I believe one minimum wage regulation does not fit every Montana community. I am open to looking at the conditions and needs in Bozeman to evaluate raising the minimum wage in our community.

                                The Citizens of Gallatin County have passed two open space bonds and the city of Bozeman passed an additional Trails, Parks and Open Space bond which indicate that preserving our wilderness areas and ag land is a priority to this community. In addition to good schools and good jobs our community values clean air, clean water, trails, parks and open space all of which add to our quality of life and quality of life is key in making communities more livable and more prosperous. While addressing the impact of development and planning for future growth is essential, protecting our quality of life is fundamental for building a strong and diverse economy. I will put my experience to work encouraging development that supports infill, more density and thoughtful neighborhood planning, discouraging sprawl and preserving our surroundings

                                In my six years on the commission, I have been very supportive of the implementation of the Climate Action plan and will continue to support the plan. I have voted to pass a budget which has included continued funding of a new water reclamation facility, a new water treatment plant, the addition of a water conservation specialist and single stream curbside recycling. This year, we passed a budget that included a funding plan to clean up our storm water, funding a full-time water conservation technician and continued funding efforts to clean up the landfill.

                                Streamline is a vital component to the community as it provides free transit service to the greater Bozeman area including Livingston and Belgrade.

                                I support the continued acquisition of the Bear Cat. I disagree with the statement that the Bear Cat equates to further militarization of our police force. I believe the Bear Cat was purchased specifically as a defense vehicle. It is considered a regional asset for Southwest Montana and as part of the grant application, the University submitted a letter of support. This vehicle can only be used as a Special Response team call out (hostage situation for example) not a misdemeanor or a civil disturbance. Outside of training, the Bear Cat has been used four times since it was acquired. The first was August of 2014 for an attempted homicide suspect in the county. The other three uses outside of training include: > An armed barricaded subject on West Olive Street in January. >An armed barricaded subject with a small child in a hotel room >And most recently our Special Response team responded to a request for assistance by Lewis and Clark County during the manhunt for the homicide suspect from Great Falls that had also committed a kidnapping and a carjacking and fled on foot into the hills around Hauser Lake. In addition to these three Special Response Team call-outs, the vehicle was used for three public education events during the reporting period: the Citizen’s Police Academy, Touch a Truck, and National Night Out.

                                The methods used to acquire the Bearcat were not achieved through the consensus of this community. The circumstances under which the Bearcat would be used were not arrived at democratically and I am personally not qualified to determine if we need one or how we would use it.

                                Last spring, I worked with members of the Bozeman Business Professional Women (BPW) to help formalize our policies addressing equal pay. On June 8, 2015, the Bozeman City Commission passed the Equal Pay for Equal Work Resolution which I promoted. I am committed to narrowing the wage gap within the City by expanding the data collection for City employees to more easily facilitate the analysis of wages by gender. I will commit to commemorating Equal Pay Day each year as long as I serve on the commission.

                                I was Co-Chair of the second Gallatin Open Space Bond committee and helped lead efforts on the first effort as well. Both were successful leading to $20 million in Open space bomds used to purchase development rights and preserve agriculture. I recognize that city and county landowners have the right to develop but encourage denser urban development on treated water and sanitary sewer. If the people of Bozeman want to encourage dense urban development, they will need to be willing to pay for infrastructure needed to achieve that goal. We can't believe in something so much that we will make the next person who comes to town paynfor it. If this is a Bozeman goal, then we all share in the cost of meeting that goal.

I also wrote a letter to the PSC supporting the purchase of dams by NWE. That purchase means that 43% of NWE's energy production is renewable hydro.

We are currently expanding our workforce housimg levies and implementing new levies for parks and trails bonds. We just imposed two new taxes for protecting the environment with a stormwater district and for traffic safety with a new collector and arterial levy. There are high school and law and justice center and swimmimg pool levies awaiting voter approval. Others need to step up on the bus system, as they have so far.

                                I was the only member of the Commission to vote to NOT to keep the tank. Since then, the Montana legislature has put controls on military equipment for local police, signed by the Governor, and President Obama has ended transfers of some military equipment as well. We had a chance to be first on that list.

                                "Militarization" of our police force is to be avoided. Use of the Bearcat is not an option except in rescue operations where it would be particularly suited for that use.
